<h3>How do we make our products?</h3>
<ol type = "1">
<li>Selecting Quality Ingredients: We source the finest wheat from local farms in the Brasov region, ensuring that only the best grains are used in our bread-making process.</li>
<li>Milling the Wheat: The harvested wheat is then milled in-house to produce the freshest flour possible, preserving its natural flavor and nutritional value</li>
<li>Crafting the Dough: Our skilled bakers combine the freshly milled flour with water, salt, and yeast to create the dough, which is kneaded by hand to develop its texture and structure.</li>
<li>Baking with Care: The dough is then shaped and allowed to rise before being baked in our wood-fired ovens, imparting a distinctive flavor and crust to the bread.</li>
<li>Delivering Freshness: Once baked to perfection, our bread is ready to be enjoyed. We take pride in delivering our bread fresh from the Brasov farms.</li>
</ol>
<p class = "quote"> From farm to table, our bread is a testament to our commitment to quality and tradition. Enjoy the taste of freshness with every slice from our bakery.</p>
